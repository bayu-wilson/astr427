This course provides a toolkit that solves problems in astrophysics.

1) Computer architecture

2) Computer Programming Languages

3) Software Engineering

CPU: A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
	ID: Instruction decode
	ALU: An arithmetic logic unit is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.
	Reg: Registers - fetch and store data
	MMU: Memory Management Unit - talks to registers. Gets data from some external chip / memory elsewhere.

Frequency is so great and the size is so small that the speed of light must be put into considerations.

Cache: many levels. A CPU cache is a hardware cache used by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer to reduce the average cost (time or energy) to access data from the main memory. 

Bus: In computer architecture, a bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.

4 processors:

TAKEAWAY
When we think about performance, what we care about is how to organize memory.
